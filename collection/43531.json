{"dataset_id": 43531, "name": "Gender-Classification-Dataset", "version": 1, "description": "Context\nWhile I was practicing machine learning, I wanted to create a simple dataset that is closely aligned to the real world scenario and gives better results to whet my appetite on this domain. If you are a beginner who wants to try solving classification problems in machine learning and if you prefer achieving better results, try using this dataset in your projects which will be a great place to start.\nContent\nThis dataset contains 7 features and a label column. \nlonghair - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is \"long hair\" and 0 is \"not long hair\".\nforeheadwidthcm - This column is in CM's. This is the width of the forehead. \nforeheadheightcm - This is the height of the forehead and it's in Cm's.\nnosewide - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is \"wide nose\" and 0 is \"not wide nose\". \nnoselong - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is \"Long nose\" and 0 is \"not long nose\".\nlipsthin - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 represents the \"thin lips\" while 0 is \"Not thin lips\".\ndistancenosetoliplong - This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 represents the \"long distance between nose and lips\" while 0 is \"short distance between nose and lips\".\ngender - This is either \"Male\" or \"Female\".\nAcknowledgements\nNothing to acknowledge as this is just a made up data.\nInspiration\nIt's painful to see bad results at the beginning. Don't begin with complicated datasets if you are a beginner. I'm sure that this dataset will encourage you to proceed further in the domain.
