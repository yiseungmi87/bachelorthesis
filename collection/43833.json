{"dataset_id": 43833, "name": "Official-World-Golf-Ranking-Data", "version": 1, "description": "Official World Golf Ranking Data\n\nContext:\nThe Official World Golf Ranking is a system for rating the performance level of male professional golfers. It was started in 1986. [1]\nThe rankings are based on a player's position in individual tournaments (i.e. not pairs or team events) over a \"rolling\" two-year period. New rankings are produced each week. During 2018, nearly 400 tournaments on 20 tours were covered by the ranking system. All players competing in these tournaments are included in the rankings. In 2019, 23 tours will factor into the world rankings. [1]\nThe World Ranking Points for each player are accumulated over a two year rolling period with the points awarded for each tournament maintained for a 13-week period to place additional emphasis on recent performances. [2]\nRanking points are then reduced in equal decrements for the remaining 91 weeks of the two year Ranking period. Each player is then ranked according to his average points per tournament, which is determined by dividing his total number of points by the tournaments he has played over that two-year period. [2]\nThere is a minimum divisor of 40 tournaments over the two year ranking period and a maximum divisor of a players last 52 tournaments. [2]\nSimply put, a golfer's World Ranking is obtained by dividing their points total by the number of events they have played, which gives their average. Players are then ranked; a higher average yields a higher rank.

There are still records where there is not enough information for me to infer the proper name of the athlete. If the name contains a date within brackets it is because there are two players with the same name. The date is the birth date of the athlete and is used to uniquely identify athletes with the same name.\n\nQuestions, Concerns  Suggestions:\n\nFeel free to email me for questions, concerns or suggestions, bradklassenoutlook.com\n\n\nResources\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking\n[2] http://www.owgr.com/about", "creator": null, "contributor": null, "collection_date": "22-04-2020", "upload_date": "2022-03-24T15:31:54", "language": "English", "license": "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0", "default_target_attribute": null, "row_id_attribute": null, "ignore_attribute": null, "tags": null, "features": [{"index": 0, "name": "Week", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 1, "name": "This_Week", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 2, "name": "Last_Week", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 5}, {"index": 3, "name": "End_2019", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 206}, {"index": 4, "name": "Name", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 5, "name": "Average_Points", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 6912}, {"index": 6, "name": "Total_Points", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 6912}, {"index": 7, "name": "Events_Played_Divisor", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 8, "name": "Points_Lost_2020", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 6932}, {"index": 9, "name": "Points_Gained_2020", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 8351}, {"index": 10, "name": "Events_Played_Actual", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 11, "name": "Pro/Am", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}], "qualities": {"AutoCorrelation": NaN, "Dimensionality": 0.0013333333333333333, "MajorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MajorityClassSize": NaN, "MinorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MinorityClassSize": NaN, "NumberOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "NumberOfClasses": NaN, "NumberOfFeatures": 12.0, "NumberOfInstances": 9000.0, "NumberOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 8394.0, "NumberOfMissingValues": 29318.0, "NumberOfNumericFeatures": 10.0, "NumberOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 93.26666666666667, "PercentageOfMissingValues": 27.146296296296295, "PercentageOfNumericFeatures": 83.33333333333334, "PercentageOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0}}
