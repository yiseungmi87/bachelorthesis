Development was crowdfunded in 2014, and the network went live on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins premined. \nSome interesting facts about Ethereum(ETH):\n\nEther (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin. Ethereum is the most actively used blockchain.\nSome of the worlds leading corporations joined the EEA(Ethereum Alliance, is a collaboration of many block start-ups) and supported further development. Some of the most famous companies are Samsung SDS, Toyota Research Institute, Banco Santander, Microsoft, J.P.Morgan, Merck GaA, Intel, Deloitte, DTCC, ING, Accenture, Consensys, Bank of Canada, and BNY Mellon.\n\nContent\nThe dataset consists of ETH prices from March-2016 to the current date(1813 days) and the dataset will be updated on a weekly basis. \nInformation regarding the data\nThe data totally consists of 1813 records(1813 days) with 7 columns.
