My contribution is very small, just daily collection, merge and upload of the updated version, as maintained by Our World in Data in their GitHub repository.\nInspiration\nTrack COVID-19 vaccination in the World, answer instantly to your questions:   \n\nWhich country is using what vaccine?   \nIn which country the vaccination programme is more advanced?   \nWhere are vaccinated more people per day?
