The game is structured as a series of levels where players need to match similar candy together to (hopefully) clear the level and keep progressing on the level map. If you are one of the few that haven't played Candy Crush\n\nContent\nCandy Crush has more than 3000 levels, and new ones are added every week. That is a lot of levels! And with that many levels, it's important to get level difficulty just right. Too easy and the game gets boring, too hard and players become frustrated and quit playing.\n\nAcknowledgements\nDataCamp", "creator": null, "contributor": null, "collection_date": "06-01-2021", "upload_date": "2022-03-23T13:24:49", "language": "English", "license": "GPL 2", "default_target_attribute": "level", "row_id_attribute": null, "ignore_attribute": null, "tags": null, "features": [{"index": 0, "name": "player_id", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 1, "name": "dt", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 2, "name": "level", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 3, "name": "num_attempts", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 4, "name": "num_success", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}], "qualities": {"AutoCorrelation": -3.8745849146110056, "Dimensionality": 0.0002964719833975689, "MajorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MajorityClassSize": NaN, "MinorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MinorityClassSize": NaN, "NumberOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "NumberOfClasses": 0.0, "NumberOfFeatures": 5.0, "NumberOfInstances": 16865.0, "NumberOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfNumericFeatures": 3.0, "NumberOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfNumericFeatures": 60.0, "PercentageOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0}}
