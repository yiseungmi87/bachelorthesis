{"dataset_id": 43758, "name": "Worldwide-Meat-Consumption", "version": 1, "description": "Context\nMeat consumption is related to living standards, diet, livestock production and consumer prices, as well as macroeconomic uncertainty and shocks to GDP. Compared to other commodities, meat is characterised by high production costs and high output prices. Meat demand is associated with higher incomes and a shift - due to urbanisation - to food consumption changes that favour increased proteins from animal sources in diets. While the global meat industry provides food and a livelihood for billions of people, it also has significant environmental and health consequences for the planet.\nThis dataset was refreshed in 2018, with world meat projections up to 2026 are presented for beef and veal, pig, poultry, and sheep. Meat consumption is measured in thousand tonnes of carcass weight (except for poultry expressed as ready to cook weight) and in kilograms of retail weight per capita. Carcass weight to retail weight conversion factors are: 0.7 for beef and veal, 0.78 for pig meat, and 0.88 for both sheep meat and poultry meat. Excludes Iceland but includes all EU 28 member countries.\nContent\nThe csv file has 5 columns:\n\nLOCATION = the country code name\nSUBJECT = The type of meat(pig, beef, etc)\nTIME = the year the data was recorded\nMEASURE = the measure used to show the value\nVALUE = The value, according to the measure\n\nAcknowledgements\nhttps://data.oecd.org/agroutput/meat-consumption.htm\nOECD/FAO (2017), OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook, OECD Agriculture statistics (database). doi: dx.doi.org/10.1787/agr-outl-data-en (Accessed on 24 January 2018)\nInspiration\nAsk questions such as:\n\nWhat country had the most meat consumption?\nWhat years had the most worldwide meat consumption?\nIs there any correlation between the type of meat and the amount being consumed?", "creator": null, "contributor": null, "collection_date": "06-09-2020", "upload_date": "2022-03-24T07:52:13", "language": "English", "license": "Database: Open Database, Contents: Database Contents", "default_target_attribute": null, "row_id_attribute": null, "ignore_attribute": null, "tags": null, "features": [{"index": 0, "name": "LOCATION", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 1, "name": "SUBJECT", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 2, "name": "MEASURE", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 3, "name": "TIME", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 4, "name": "Value", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}], "qualities": {"AutoCorrelation": NaN, "Dimensionality": 0.0003633720930232558, "MajorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MajorityClassSize": NaN, "MinorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MinorityClassSize": NaN, "NumberOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "NumberOfClasses": NaN, "NumberOfFeatures": 5.0, "NumberOfInstances": 13760.0, "NumberOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfNumericFeatures": 2.0, "NumberOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfNumericFeatures": 40.0, "PercentageOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0}}
