Message passing is used as the communication mechanism in which any processor can submit to the network a point-to-point message destined at any other processor. M/M/1 queue is considered in the calculations which consist of a First-in First-Out buffer with packet arriving randomly according to a Poisson arrival process, and a processor, that retrieves packets from the buffer at a specified service rate. In all simulations, it is assumed that the processor at each node extracts a packet from an input queue, processes it for a period of time and when that period expires, it generates an output data message. The size of each input queue is assumed as infinite. A processor becomes idle only when all its input queues are empty.\n\n### Attribute Information \n\n1. Node Number: The number of the nodes in the network. (8x8 or 4x4).`\n2. Thread Number: The number of threads in each node at the beginning of the simulation.`\n3. Spatial Distribution: The performance of the network is evaluated using synthetic traffic workloads. Uniform (UN), Hot Region (HR), Bit reverse (BR) and Perfect Shuffle (PS) traffic models have been included.`\n4. Temporal Distribution: Temporal distribution of packet generation is implemented by independent traffic sources. In our simulations, we utilized client\u00e2\u20ac\u201cserver traffic (i.e., a server node sends packets to respond to the reception of packets from clients) and asynchronous traffic (i.e., initially, all nodes generate traffic independently of the others; as time progresses, traffic generation at the source/destination nodes depends`\n5. on the receipt of messages from destination/source nodes).`\n6. T/R: Message transfer time (T ) Uniformly distributed with mean in range from 20 to 100 clock cycles. Thread run time (R) Exponentially distributed with a mean of 100 clock cycles.`\n7. Processor Utilization: The average processor utilization measures the percent of time that threads are running in the processor.`\n8. Channel Waiting Time: Average waiting time of a packet at the output channel queue until it is serviced by the channel.`\n9. Input Waiting Time: Average waiting time of a packet until it is serviced by the processor.`\n10. Network Response Time: The time between a request message is enqueued at the output channel and the corresponding data message is received in the input queue.`\n11. Channel Utilization: The percent of time that the channel is busy transferring packets to the network.`", "creator": ["Cigdem Inan Aci", "Mehmet Fatih Akay"], "contributor": null, "collection_date": null, "upload_date": "2020-04-19T02:47:04", "language": null, "license": "CC0", "default_target_attribute": null, "row_id_attribute": null, "ignore_attribute": null, "tags": null, "features": [{"index": 0, "name": "Node_Number", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 1, "name": "Thread_Number", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 2, "name": "Spatial_Distribution", "data_type": "nominal", "nominal_values": ["BR", "HR", "PS", "UN"], "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 3, "name": "Temporal_Distribution", "data_type": "nominal", "nominal_values": ["Asynchronous", "Client-Server"], "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 4, "name": "T_R", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 5, "name": "Processor_Utilization", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 6, "name": "Channel_Waiting_Time", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 7, "name": "Input_Waiting_Time", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 8, "name": "Network_Response_Time", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 9, "name": "Channel_Utilization", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}], "qualities": {"AutoCorrelation": NaN, "Dimensionality": 0.015625, "MajorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MajorityClassSize": NaN, "MinorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MinorityClassSize": NaN, "NumberOfBinaryFeatures": 1.0, "NumberOfClasses": NaN, "NumberOfFeatures": 10.0, "NumberOfInstances": 640.0, "NumberOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfNumericFeatures": 8.0, "NumberOfSymbolicFeatures": 2.0, "PercentageOfBinaryFeatures": 10.0, "PercentageOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfNumericFeatures": 80.0, "PercentageOfSymbolicFeatures": 20.0}}
