{"dataset_id": 43312, "name": "Complete-Historical-Cryptocurrency-Financial-Data", "version": 1, "description": "Context\nRecent growing interest in cryptocurrencies, specifically as a speculative investment vehicle, has sparked global conversation over the past 12 months. Although this data is available across various sites, there is a lack of understanding as to what is driving the exponential rise of many individual currencies. This data set is intended to be a starting point for a detailed analysis into what is driving price action, and what can be done to predict future movement.\nContent\nConsolidated financial information for the top 10 cryptocurrencies by marketcap. Pulled from CoinMarketCap.com. Attributes include:\n\nCurrency name (e.g. bitcoin)\nDate  \nOpen\nHigh\nLow\nClose\nVolume\nMarketcap\n\nInspiration\nFor the past few months I have been searching for a reliable source for historical price information related to cryptocurrencies. I wasn't able to find anything that I could use to my liking, so I built my own data set.\nI've written a small script that scrapes historical price information for the top 200 coins by market cap as listed on CoinMarketCap.com.\nI plan to run some basic analysis on it to answer questions that I have a \"gut\" feeling about, but no quantitative evidence (yet).\nQuestions such as: \n\nWhat is the correlation between bitcoin and alt coin prices\nWhat is the average age of the top 10 coins by market cap\nWhat day of the week is best to buysell\nWhich coins in the top two hundred are less than 6 months old\nWhich currencies are the most volatile \nWhat the hell happens when we go to bed and Asia starts trading\n\nFeel free to use this for your own purposes I just ask that you share your results with the group when complete.
