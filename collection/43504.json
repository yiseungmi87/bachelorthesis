You easily find the full information if you want to work with more features and more data.\nWhat can I do with that?\nHave fun! The variety of feature types should allow you to gain a few interesting insights or build some simple models.\nNote\nIf you think the License (CC0: Public Domain) should be different, contact me", "creator": null, "contributor": null, "collection_date": "01-02-2020", "upload_date": "2022-03-23T13:31:10", "language": "English", "license": "CC0: Public Domain", "default_target_attribute": null, "row_id_attribute": null, "ignore_attribute": null, "tags": null, "features": [{"index": 0, "name": "subreddit", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 1, "name": "body", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 1}, {"index": 2, "name": "controversiality", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 3, "name": "score", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}], "qualities": {"AutoCorrelation": NaN, "Dimensionality": 4e-06, "MajorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MajorityClassSize": NaN, "MinorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MinorityClassSize": NaN, "NumberOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "NumberOfClasses": NaN, "NumberOfFeatures": 4.0, "NumberOfInstances": 1000000.0, "NumberOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 1.0, "NumberOfMissingValues": 1.0, "NumberOfNumericFeatures": 2.0, "NumberOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 9.999999999999999e-05, "PercentageOfMissingValues": 2.4999999999999998e-05, "PercentageOfNumericFeatures": 50.0, "PercentageOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0}}
