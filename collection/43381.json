Here i have scrapped data from Coursera official web site.  Our project aims to help any new learner get the right course to learn by just answering a few questions. It is an intelligent course recommendation system. Hence we had to scrap data from few educational websites. This is data scrapped from Coursera website. For the project visit: https://github.com/Siddharth1698/Coursu . Please do show your support by following us. I have just started to learn on data science and hope this dataset will be helpful to someone for his/her personal purposes. The scrapping code is here : https://github.com/Siddharth1698/Coursera-Course-Dataset\nArticle about the dataset generation : https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/web-scraping-and-coursera-8db6af45d83f  \n\nContent\nThis dataset contains mainly 6 columns and 890 course data. The detailed description:\n\ncourse_title : Contains the course title.\ncourse_organization : It tells which organization is conducting the courses.\ncourseCertificatetype : It has details about what are the different certifications available in courses.\ncourse_rating : It has the ratings associated with each course.\ncourse_difficulty : It tells about how difficult or what is the level of the course.\ncoursestudentsenrolled : It has the number of students that are enrolled in the course.\n\nInspiration\nThis is just one of my first scraped dataset.
