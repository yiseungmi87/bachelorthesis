Starting from scrapping the whole URLs provided on Genius.com for Game of Thrones series. Process on scrapping and cleaning the dataset required a lot of time and effort in which I managed to utilize wide range of package available for collecting and compiling data scattered all over the internet.\nThis dataset is inspired by previous similar dataset published by Ander Fernndez Jauregui on https://www.kaggle.com/anderfj/game-of-thrones-series-scripts-breakdowns. I was waiting for him to update the dataset to do some analysis on them. Unfortunately, it was a long time since he last updated the dataset. Therefore, following some of his practice I generated this dataset, and hopefully will be a good use for anyone or at least for my personal analysis.\nContent\nThe content inside is a complete set of Game of Thrones script for all seasons in form of a table containing 6 columns with different data types used for various purposes. Description on each columns are provided on the data description part.\nAcknowledgements\nGreat credits for Genius.com to published the whole script of Game of Thrones series completely. Also, kudos to all of the open source packages out there, as well as people who are contributing on them so we can utilize those packages as we pleases.\nInspiration\nThere is only one question that I want to find answer using this dataset.
