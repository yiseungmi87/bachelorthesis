The plaintiffs in this case were all female doctors at Houston College of Medicine who claimed that the College has engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination against women in giving promotions and setting salaries. The Lead plaintiff in this action, a pediatrician and an assistant professor, was denied for promotion at the College. The plaintiffs had presented a set of data to show that female faculty at the school were less likely to be full professors, more likely to be assistant professors, and earn less money than men, on average.\n1 Dept                1=Biochemistry/Molecular Biology\n                            2=Physiology\n                            3=Genetics\n                            4=Pediatrics\n                            5=Medicine\n                            6=Surgery\n2 Gender           1=Male, 0=Female\n3 Clin                  1=Primarily clinical emphasis, 0=Primarily research emphasis\n4 Cert                 1=Board certified, 0=not certified\n5 Prate               Publication rate ( publications on cv)/( years between CV date and MD date)\n6 Exper               years since obtaining MD\n7 Rank               1=Assistant, 2=Associate, 3=Full professor (a proxy for productivity)\n8 Sal94              Salary in academic year 1994\n9 Sal95              Salary after increment to 1994\nAcknowledgements\nWe wouldn't be here without the help of others.
