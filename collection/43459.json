{"dataset_id": 43459, "name": "Metro-Manila-Flood-Landscape-Data", "version": 1, "description": "Context\nCompiled dataset of flood reports that include specific coordinates, average precipitation, land elevation and reported flood height in Metro Manila, Philippines. The following data was acquired by applying spatial kriging (using ARCGIS, and some python scripts) on flood reports, elevation rasters and average precipitation all around Metro Manila based on data acquired from public government data. The initial intention for this dataset was to create a heat map to find a correlation between all the parameters in this dataset. \nContent\nLatitude - lat\nLongitude - lon\nFlood Height - flood_height\n0 - No flood\n1 - Ankle High\n2 - Knee High\n3 - Waist High\n4 - Neck High\n5 - Top of Head High\n6 - 1-storey High\n7 - 1.5-storey High\n8 - 2-storeys or Higher\nElevation - elevation (meters)\nPrecipitation - precipitat (millimetres/hour)\nAcknowledgements\nCredits to these websites which have made it possible to derive these datasets:\nProject NOAH - http://noah.up.edu.ph/\nNAMRIA - http://www.namria.gov.ph/ \nInspiration\nMetro Manila is always flooded due to frequent tropical storms in the country. I wanted to identify which areas are quite prone to flooding, and which ones are potential evacuation centers. \nP.S This was a hobby project of mine when I was in studying in the university. I have been looking at your comments/feedback and I can no longer find my raw dataset which included the dates of the flood reports, and other relevant data for predictive analysis. Fortunately, the websites still have the raw data you might be looking for. I'll try to update this dataset if I find time.", "creator": null, "contributor": null, "collection_date": "09-06-2017", "upload_date": "2022-03-23T13:22:41", "language": "English", "license": "CC0: Public Domain", "default_target_attribute": null, "row_id_attribute": null, "ignore_attribute": null, "tags": null, "features": [{"index": 0, "name": "lat", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 1, "name": "lon", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 2, "name": "flood_heig", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 3, "name": "elevation", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 4, "name": "precipitat", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}], "qualities": {"AutoCorrelation": NaN, "Dimensionality": 0.0014245014245014246, "MajorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MajorityClassSize": NaN, "MinorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MinorityClassSize": NaN, "NumberOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "NumberOfClasses": NaN, "NumberOfFeatures": 5.0, "NumberOfInstances": 3510.0, "NumberOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfNumericFeatures": 5.0, "NumberOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfNumericFeatures": 100.0, "PercentageOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0}}
