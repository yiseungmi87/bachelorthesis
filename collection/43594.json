{"dataset_id": 43594, "name": "World-Happiness-Ranking", "version": 1, "description": "Context\nThe World Happiness Ranking focuses on the social, urban, and natural environment. Specifically, the ranking relies on self-reports from residents of how they weigh the quality of life they are currently experiencing which englobes three main points: current life evaluation, expected future life evaluation, positive and negative affect (emotion). Half of the underlying data comes from multiple Gallup world polls which asked people to give their assessment of the previously mentioned points, and the other half of the data is comprised of six variables that could be used to try to explain the individuals perception in their answers.\nContent\nThe data sources datasets were obtained in two different formats. The World Happiness Ranking Dataset is a Comma-separated Values (CSV) file with multiple columns (for the different variables and the score) and a row for each of the analyzed countries. \nThe rankings of national happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The report correlates the results with various life factors.\n\nGDP per capita is in terms of Purchasing\nPower Parity (PPP) adjusted to constant\n2011 international dollars, taken from\nthe World Development Indicators\n(WDI) released by the World Bank on\nNovember 28, 2019. See Statistical\nAppendix 1 for more details. GDP data\nfor 2019 are not yet available, so we\nextend the GDP time series from 2018\nto 2019 using country-specific forecasts\nof real GDP growth from the OECD\nEconomic Outlook No. 106 (Edition\nNovember 2019) and the World Banks\nGlobal Economic Prospects (Last\nUpdated: 06/04/2019), after adjustment\nfor population growth. The equation\nuses the natural log of GDP per capita,\nas this form fits the data significantly\nbetter than GDP per capita.\nThe time series of healthy life expectancy\nat birth are constructed based on data\nfrom the World Health Organization\n(WHO) Global Health Observatory data\nrepository, with data available for 2005,\n2010, 2015, and 2016. To match this\nreports sample period, interpolation and\nextrapolation are used. See Statistical\nAppendix 1 for more details.\nSocial support is the national average of\nthe binary responses (0=no, 1=yes) to\nthe Gallup World Poll (GWP) question, If\nyou were in trouble, do you have relatives\nor friends you can count on to help you\nwhenever you need them, or not?\nFreedom to make life choices is the\nnational average of binary responses\nto the GWP question, Are you satisfied\nor dissatisfied with your freedom to\nchoose what you do with your life?\nGenerosity is the residual of regressing\nthe national average of GWP responses\nto the question, Have you donated\nmoney to a charity in the past month?\non GDP per capita.\nPerceptions of corruption are the average\nof binary answers to two GWP questions:\nIs corruption widespread throughout the\ngovernment or not? and Is corruption\nwidespread within businesses or not?\nWhere data for government corruption\nare missing, the perception of business\ncorruption is used as the overall\ncorruption-perception measure.\nPositive affect is defined as the average\nof previous-day affect measures for\nhappiness, laughter, and enjoyment for\nGWP waves 3-7 (years 2008 to 2012, and\nsome in 2013). It is defined as the average\nof laughter and enjoyment for other\nwaves where the happiness question was\nnot asked. The general form for the\naffect questions is: Did you experience\nthe following feelings during a lot of the\nday yesterday? See Statistical Appendix\n1 for more details.\nNegative affect is defined as the average\nof previous-day affect measures for\nworry, sadness, and anger in all years.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe World Happiness Report is a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, powered by data from the Gallup World Poll, and supported by the Ernesto Illy Foundation, illycaff, Davines Group, Blue Chip Foundation, the William, Jeff, and Jennifer Gross Family Foundation, and Unilevers largest ice cream brand Walls.\nInspiration\nFind the relationship between the ladder score and the other pieces of data.", "creator": null, "contributor": null, "collection_date": "23-05-2020", "upload_date": "2022-03-24T00:32:51", "language": "English", "license": "GPL 2", "default_target_attribute": null, "row_id_attribute": null, "ignore_attribute": null, "tags": null, "features": [{"index": 0, "name": "Country_name", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 1, "name": "Regional_indicator", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 2, "name": "Ladder_score", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 3, "name": "Standard_error_of_ladder_score", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 4, "name": "upperwhisker", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 5, "name": "lowerwhisker", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 6, "name": "Logged_GDP_per_capita", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 7, "name": "Social_support", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 8, "name": "Healthy_life_expectancy", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 9, "name": "Freedom_to_make_life_choices", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 10, "name": "Generosity", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 11, "name": "Perceptions_of_corruption", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 12, "name": "Ladder_score_in_Dystopia", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 13, "name": "Explained_by:_Log_GDP_per_capita", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 14, "name": "Explained_by:_Social_support", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 15, "name": "Explained_by:_Healthy_life_expectancy", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 16, "name": "Explained_by:_Freedom_to_make_life_choices", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 17, "name": "Explained_by:_Generosity", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 18, "name": "Explained_by:_Perceptions_of_corruption", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 19, "name": "Dystopia_+_residual", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}], "qualities": {"AutoCorrelation": NaN, "Dimensionality": 0.13071895424836602, "MajorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MajorityClassSize": NaN, "MinorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MinorityClassSize": NaN, "NumberOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "NumberOfClasses": NaN, "NumberOfFeatures": 20.0, "NumberOfInstances": 153.0, "NumberOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfNumericFeatures": 18.0, "NumberOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfNumericFeatures": 90.0, "PercentageOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0}}
