{"dataset_id": 43842, "name": "League-of-Legend-High-Elo-Team-Comp--Game-Length", "version": 1, "description": "Context\nI was exploring League of Legends datasets to play around but since Riot allows limited calls to their API, I've collected the data from OP.GG. \nFew goals of mine were to find out the best team compositions and to predict Victory/Loss given a team comp and game length. The most recent games on the dataset are on 2020 October 16th. \nContent\nThe dataset consists of ranked matches from Korea(WWW), North America(NA), Eastern Europe(EUNE), and Western Europe(EUW) servers. It has which team won the match, the total time of the match,  blue team composition and red team composition. Note that only the high elo games were added this includes Challenger, Grand Master, Master and sometimes even High Diamonds. Note that there are 151 total unique champions with 'Samira' as the latest addition.\n\nYou may find my blog post useful.
