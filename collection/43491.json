How does one measure the difficulty of a level?  A first-cut solution is \nto make an auto-play bot that is not perfect, and see how well the bot does on each level, using thousands of trials.\nHere is a video of the game in auto-play action.\nFields\n\nDate: date and time the game was auto-played\nLevel: the name of the level (the 3-digit number is an estimate of the difficulty from a previous run, no longer valid after tweaking)\nNumBlocks: how many blocks have to be broken to win the level\nIsWin: True if autoplay broke all the blocks, False if the ball fell past the paddle.\nElapsedTime: Seconds until either won or lost (game is played at 4x speed, so multiply by 4 to get an estimate of how long a human might play it)\nScore: total score when the game was won or lost\nAccuracy: the autoplay is tuned with a randomly-chosen accuracy.  Higher numbers are more likely to win.", "creator": null, "contributor": null, "collection_date": "10-09-2019", "upload_date": "2022-03-23T13:27:37", "language": "English", "license": "CC0: Public Domain", "default_target_attribute": null, "row_id_attribute": null, "ignore_attribute": null, "tags": null, "features": [{"index": 0, "name": "Date", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 1, "name": "Level", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 2, "name": "NumBlocks", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 3, "name": "IsWin", "data_type": "nominal", "nominal_values": ["True", "False"], "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 4, "name": "ElapsedTime", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 5, "name": "Score", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 6, "name": "Accuracy", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}], "qualities": {"AutoCorrelation": NaN, "Dimensionality": 0.001027296742001761, "MajorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MajorityClassSize": NaN, "MinorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MinorityClassSize": NaN, "NumberOfBinaryFeatures": 1.0, "NumberOfClasses": NaN, "NumberOfFeatures": 7.0, "NumberOfInstances": 6814.0, "NumberOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfNumericFeatures": 4.0, "NumberOfSymbolicFeatures": 1.0, "PercentageOfBinaryFeatures": 14.285714285714285, "PercentageOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfNumericFeatures": 57.14285714285714, "PercentageOfSymbolicFeatures": 14.285714285714285}}
