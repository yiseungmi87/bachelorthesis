{"dataset_id": 43602, "name": "FEER-Dataset", "version": 1, "description": "Content\nThis database contains six basic emotions (happiness, surprise, anger, fear, disgust, and sadness) of normalized (average mean reference) data and collected from 85 undergraduate university students (55 male; 30 female) aged between 20 - 27 years with a mean age of 24.5 years. The data which contain noises and other movement artifacts are removed from the raw data. A built-in face time HD camera in Apple Mac Pro with a resolution of 2560  1600 at 227 pixels per inch is used to collect the facial images in a controlled environment (25C room temperature with 50 Lux lighting intensity) at 30 frames per second. All the subjects are seated comfortably in a chair in front of the camera and the distance between the subject face to the camera is 0.95m. A computerized PowerPoint slides are used to instruct the subjects to express the facial emotional expression by looking into the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) images of six different emotions. The data file contains 11 columns (10 columns for 10 markers and the last column represents the label of emotion) and 190968 rows. In the file (labels), 0 refers to Angry, 1 refers to Disgust, 2 refers to Fear, 3 refers to Sad, 4 refers to Happy, and 5 refer to S to Surprise.  Each emotion has 10 trials and each trial has a duration of 6 sec. In between the emotional expressions, 10 sec of break is given to the subjects to feel calm by showing natural scenes. The PowerPoint show starts with a set of instructions at the beginning of the experiment of 10-sec duration.  The computing system continuously records the marker positions and saved them in comma-separated values (CSV) format for further processing.
