{"dataset_id": 43838, "name": "Municipal-Debt-Risk-Analysis", "version": 1, "description": "Context\nThis data has been extracted from the billing systems of 8 Municipalities in South Africa over a 2 year period and summarised according to their total amount billed versus the total amount paid. For each account there is an indicator of whether that account resulted in a Bad Debt.\nThis is a Classification exercise with the aim of finding out whether it is feasible to determine the probability of an account becoming a Bad Debt so that it will be possible to forecast the number (and value) of accounts that are at risk of developing into a Bad Debt.\nContent\nAccCategoryID: (Account Category ID) The numeric link in the database to the Account Category\nAccCategory: (Account Category) A classification of the type of account\nAccCategoryAbbr: (Account Category Abbreviation) An abbreviation of the classification of the type of account - to be used for One-hot encoding\nPropertyValue: (Property Value) The market value of the property\nPropertySize: (Property Size) The size of the property in square metres\nTotalBilling: (Total Billing) The total amount billed to the account for all services\nAverageBilling: (Average Billing) The average amount billed to the account for all services\nTotalReceipting: (Total Receipting) The total amount receipted to the account for all services\nAverageReceipting: (Average Receipting) The average amount receipted to the account for all services\nTotalDebt: (Total Debt) The Total Debt that is at 90 days or more\nTotalWriteOff: (Total Write Off) The Total amount of debt that has been written off\nCollectionRatio: (Collection Ratio) The ratio between the Total Receipting and Total Billing (ie. Total Receipting/Total Billing)\nDebtBillingRatio: (Billing Debt Ratio) The ratio between the Total Debt and Total Billing (ie. (Total Debt + Total Write Off)/Total Billing)\nTotalElectricityBill: (Total Electricity Bill) The total amount billed for electricity. This field was put in place because it is used as a means to recover debt - ie. If an amount is outstanding for any service the municipality has the right to cut a consumer's electricity connection.\nHasIDNo: (Has ID No.) The consumer has an ID number. This is similar to a Social Security number in the US and can be useful in legal proceedings. A consumer without any ID No. details is a lot harder to collect debt from. In addition, this field denotes that the account is held by a person and not a business. However, it is not very reliable as it's often not captured properly or at all.\nBadDebtIndic: (Bad Debt Indicator) 1 = Is considered to be a Bad Debt, 0 = Not considered to be a Bad Debt\nInspiration\nI welcome any feedback on the dataset as well as my methodology in classifying and modelling this dataset. The kernel that I have run against this dataset is my first and I am now working on a second attempt with different parameters. Any advice, criticisms etc - will be much appreciated", "creator": null, "contributor": null, "collection_date": "04-06-2020", "upload_date": "2022-03-24T15:33:08", "language": "English", "license": "CC0: Public Domain", "default_target_attribute": null, "row_id_attribute": null, "ignore_attribute": null, "tags": null, "features": [{"index": 0, "name": "accountcategoryid", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 1, "name": "accountcategory", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 2, "name": "acccatabbr", "data_type": "string", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 3, "name": "propertyvalue", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 4, "name": "propertysize", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 5, "name": "totalbilling", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 6, "name": "avgbilling", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 7, "name": "totalreceipting", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 8, "name": "avgreceipting", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 9, "name": "total90debt", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 10, "name": "totalwriteoff", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 11, "name": "collectionratio", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 12, "name": "debtbillingratio", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 13, "name": "totalelecbill", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 14, "name": "hasidno", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}, {"index": 15, "name": "baddebt", "data_type": "numeric", "nominal_values": null, "number_missing_values": 0}], "qualities": {"AutoCorrelation": NaN, "Dimensionality": 0.00011551595925174537, "MajorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MajorityClassSize": NaN, "MinorityClassPercentage": NaN, "MinorityClassSize": NaN, "NumberOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "NumberOfClasses": NaN, "NumberOfFeatures": 16.0, "NumberOfInstances": 138509.0, "NumberOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfMissingValues": 0.0, "NumberOfNumericFeatures": 14.0, "NumberOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfBinaryFeatures": 0.0, "PercentageOfInstancesWithMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfMissingValues": 0.0, "PercentageOfNumericFeatures": 87.5, "PercentageOfSymbolicFeatures": 0.0}}
