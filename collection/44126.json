EUROSIS.       \n\n**Bank Marketing**  \nThe data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. \n\nThe classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).\n\n### Attribute information  \nFor more information, read [Moro et al., 2011].\n\nInput variables:\n\n- bank client data:\n\n1 - age (numeric) \n\n2 - job : type of job (categorical: \"admin.\",\"unknown\",\"unemployed\",\"management\",\"housemaid\",\"entrepreneur\", \"student\",\"blue-collar\",\"self-employed\",\"retired\",\"technician\",\"services\") \n\n3 - marital : marital status (categorical: \"married\",\"divorced\",\"single\"; note: \"divorced\"  means divorced or widowed) \n\n4 - education (categorical: \"unknown\",\"secondary\",\"primary\",\"tertiary\") \n\n5 - default: has credit in default?
